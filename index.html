        <h2> Education Background </h2>
        <p>Nikki Rozen attended Bergen County Technical High School in Teterboro, New Jersey from the fall of 2017 to the spring of 2021. Earning an associate of the arts degree in fashion design and merchandising, she graduated and preceded to attend the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida in the spring of 2022. Currently an undergraduate journalism and media management major in the School of Communication, Nikki has one year left of studies. The future is awaiting for her as she hopes to pursue her endeavors in modeling and social media marketing/ influencing.  
        </p>
        <h2> Modeling  </h2>
        <p> Moving to a city like Miami in December of 2021 caused opportunities to come way. Nikki pursued modeling for an array of small brands and business' social media until getting scouted in Los Angeles. Scouted by Genetics Management- which is based in NYC - Nikki began pursuing her modeling career with more seriousness and landed her first magazine spread with Elle Ukraine in the fall of 2023. Shortly after, she shot an editorial in Madison Square Garden for L'Officiel Magazine. Now, in 2024, she will be traveling to LA for work and contemplating the decision of traveling internationally in 2025.
        </p>
        <h2> Microinfluencing & Using Instagram as a Platform </h2>
        <p> With being in Miami and at the time young and blonde, making connections was relatively easy. Posting whereabouts, tonight's dinner and yesterday's outfit garnered enough attention on social media that Nikki began to post religiously. Navigating Instagram's algorithm and landing on the explore page for numerous professional athletes, businesses began to contact for promotional work. Recieving PR from beauty to fashion brands, Nikki started the art of "collabing" with companies in different sectors: entertainment, fashion, and health/fitness. The gifting evolved to paid partnerships in early 2023 and since then, Nikki's instagram is her selling point and business.
