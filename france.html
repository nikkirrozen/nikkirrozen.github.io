            <h1>France</h1>
            <p> One of the most modern countries in the world and a leader among European nations, France plays an important global role in the United Nations. It is constructed on a hybrid presidential-parliamentary governing system since 1958. Cooperating with Germany has led to the economic integration of Europe and the intro of the Euro currency in January of 1999. In the early 21st Century, five French entities became regions and made part of France: French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte, and Reunion.</p>
