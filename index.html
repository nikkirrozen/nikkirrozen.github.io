            Welcome! Meet Nikki. Nikki Rozen is 20-year old incoming senior at
            the University of Miami. Majoring in journalism and media management
            with a minor in political science, she's always loved the art of
            writing. As she works with brands via social media and uses her
            platform to promote her writing, she's also signed with Genetics
            Model Management in NYC and pursues the modeling industry as well.
            Here, you will dive into both of her creative fields and take a
            glimpse into her portfolios.
