          - named after one of her favorite bands - Nikki has quite the creative
          side. Specializing in the romance genre, her poems dive into raw
          passion and lust that reflect into her past emotions and
          relationships. Lately, some of her content has been motivated by
          real-life stories and inspiration. Read through and understand her
          imagination through a poetic lens.

              'Love takes off masks that we fear we cannot live without and know
              we cannot live within. She met him with his mask on. But over
              those nights staying up and talking even as the eyelids fought to
              close and over those laughs, his hands shook to unveil his true
              form. As he met her, he fell in love with her smile, her eyes, and
              the way she bloked at him. She didn't judge him, but rather
              encouraged and listened. She didn't shy away from his past, but
              rather leaned in and wanted to learn more. This scared him. As his
              mask was starting to come off, he couldn't see himself without it.
              Fearful of the new man he could possibly be becoming, he ran away
              from her and took the mask with him. Escaping his thoughts and
              trying to erase her face that's ingrained in his mind, he looks to
              fill the void with distractions, but that's all they'll ever be.
              Distractions. Love takes off masks that we fear we cannot live
              without and know we cannot live within. Eventually, his mask will
              be glued to him permanently and he will not recognize the man he
              is, but she's seen him and she knows. She will now always know.

            <p>
              I used to think that hope was an excuse for staying in the same
              cycle - that same toxic relationship -the same 9-5 that you just
              fucking hate so much -surrounded by the same people But what if it
              was the only reason the person stayed? Nights of tears Voicemails
              piling up in your inbox Yelling at the world He loves me. He will
              change. Ibope. She loves me. She will change. I hope Eye bags as
              big as the price of a panthÈre de cartier Anxiety seeping through
              your veins A sorrow sweeps over you as the pen clicks The thumping
              of your foot becomes your solace This job is so depressing. I hope
              I'll get promoted. I hope my boss likes me. Crossroads you've
              memorized as a child Cars lined up as the familiar faces wave back
              at you You recognize them, But do they recognize you? Small town,
              small environment. Big city, big dreams. "Hey, pass me that
              lighter" Smoke fills your vision - The jokes no longer funny The
              meetup no longer satisfying I bope they grow out of this shit.
              That's the thing. Hope is a dangerous thing. It can either lead
              you up the hill or down into an abyss. Hoping is accompanied by
              faith Perseverance Work ethic Hunger for greatness. If they loved
              me, they'd change. I'm walking away. I hate this job. What should
              I do? They don't get me further in life. I need to distance
              myself. That's how you become great.

              Hugging her curves, pecking cleavage, playing with her soft skin -
              her dresses were short and scandalous. Hours pass and she's
              brushed her lean fingers through her tousled hair twenty times
              over, waiting for him. She was always waiting for his call and oh
              how she couldn't sleep without it. Bering checks with rocmay bus,
              in elp it he sme prick a yed and prying the perfume has she hope
              vi have him desire her enough to call every night. Waking up and
              letting her mind jump to him - Good morning:) Seconds turn into
              minutes. Minutes into hours. Good morning. It's 5 pm. Exhausted
              emotionally and mentally, she slams her head against her pillow.
              Dragging her social battery out longer in believing that today is
              the day she will learn more besides what he did that day. Stepping
              out of her comfort zone, she went through dark alleyways. Stepping
              out of her comfort zone, she walked city streets in stilettos.
              Stepping out of her comfort zone, she navigated parties, bars,
              clubs to have an excuse, any, to run into him. Hey, have you seen
              him? She's pointed to his shadowy figure. As her confidence begins
              to grow, it shatters like sharp waves against the banks on a
              frosty night in Maine. Her eyes became so wet with anger. He was
              laughing, touching. He was whispering in a girl's ear, a girl that
              could never be her. Her blood boiled in desperation and
              frustration. She felt like a ghost in his presence. All this time
              she was loving him and oh how he was turning a blind eye. Her
              dress was his favorite. He complimented her figure in it a year
              ago and she had kept the dress since. Her perfume was his
              favorite. He mentioned sandalwood in a passing conversation.

              at war with myself. Michael, pick up your speed. Train harder.
              Your performance is weak. Blow. Atta boy Mikey! Keep your head in

              escape. But I was looking to escape Myself And in the process I
              was ruining Everything: health, my olympic dream, and my mind.
              Save me I'd pray to a god that won't talk back. Heart racing, eyes
              pulsing, I woke up in a sterilized environment; A blue gown on the
              lighting stark and my hands numb. Grappling with life and death, I
              feared I had died already. Was I too late? "What happened?" My

              was a fool For you. Your hands played every corner So skillfully
              So beautifully like Frederic Chopin at a piano. I wanted to talk
              But my mind struggled to find words And fight against the Lust. It

          <div class="poetry-content">
            <p>
              He made you feel the way Summer by Calvin Harris makes one feel:
              alive, unbeatable, invincible, and so very happy. The way your
              hands would fly out the window, hair slapping you in the face and
              possibly getting into your mouth, sticking to the lip gloss you
              had just applied prior to kissing him. He spoke of eloquence like
              Frank Ocean. Calming, inviting, reflective is who he was. His
              thoughts were like Pink + White being serenaded to you on a cool
              spring night. So much to think and so much to say, he filled the
              room in your head with everything he is. He dressed you in his
              style from head to toe, his wardrobe spread out in this room. He
              moved himself in and you let him. His heart was of Brent Faiyaz'.
              Fearful, entranced, and a lovaboy secretly, Faiyaz songs teach you
              about a man trying to run from himself and to not only fover your
              heart, but how he was shielding his very one just as he has been
              accustomed to. All Mine was his possessiveness. Dominance radiated
              off of him. He wanted to feel like a king and the second you
              threatened his power or confidence, you were no longer welcomed.
              His demons were at battle with him. Confused, he couldn't
              communicate so he hopes you wou an't leave him no matter how many
              times he leaves you. Angel is what he calls you because you see
              beyond what people see in him. You see the good and believe in it,
              no matter how hurt you may be. He made you feel the way Summer by
              Calvin Harris makes one feel: alive, unbeatable, invincible, and
              so very happy. Three minutes and 42 seconds. Just how short that
              song is was how short this love had been. But whenever you play
              this song, those feelings come back and never wash away. He was
              Summer.

              Fighting with the shadows in your head, living out the same old
              moment, knowing you'd be better off if you said what you had to
              say. Imagining life with her through a tape in your mind, but as
              soon as the tape begins to play, the visions are grainy because
              time has been slipping away. Fearful of giving in and becoming
              vulnerable, there's a padlock to your thoughts but how long can
              that door stay shut until the room goes on fire? Once that room
              explodes, everything you could ve saved would be gone, including
              her. It's better to say too much than never to say what ou need to
              say again. Even if your faith is broken and the tears are
              streamingdo it with a heart wide open. Say what you need to say
              before you are walking in their clothes on the streets where you
              have met them. Now, they are nothing but a distant memory. The
              picture of you is replaced with someone new and they've fallen in
              love. All has progressed within time. All, but you.

              you made me think you were different from the tens of guys I come
              across, all saying the same thing and all looking at me the same
              way. I hate how I started to see a life with you and ease up,
              thinking "No, I'll be okay." I hate how I let my guard down and I
              shut out every other guy for you. I hate how I built up such
              expectations, only to be heavily disappointed. That's the thing.
              What I really hate is just how much I would do this all over. I
              would do it all over again if it meant another day with you.
